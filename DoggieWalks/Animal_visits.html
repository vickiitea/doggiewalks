       <p>If you would solely like me to come over and visit your pets while you are away I can do that too. This does not include overnights but does include what any visit should: Walk, fresh water, cuddling time, feeding, potty breaks, petting and playing. And for kitties the same: litter, food, petting, brushing and anything else you need, please tell me and I am sure I can accomodate you.</p>
