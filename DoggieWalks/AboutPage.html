           <p class="abouttext">DoggieWalks founder Nicole
           Spooner grew up fostering and volunteering with
           various animal rescue organizations and caring for
           her own pets. She took her true love of animals and
           became a Veterinary Technician.<br>
           <br>Ten years ago, Nicole turned this passion into a
           business that could benefit both pets and the owners
           who love them. She wanted her business to stand out
           from other dog-walking businesses, making it more
           personal for both the clients and their furry
           friends.<br>
           <br>Instead of constantly switching up the walkers like other companies, DoggieWalks strives to create long lasting, personal relationships between dogs and
           their walkers to maximize their self-growth and ensure their individual needs are being met. By assigning each dog the same walker for every walk, we
           see happier dogs, happier walkers, and happier clients.</p>
